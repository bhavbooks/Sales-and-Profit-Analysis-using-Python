# Sales & Profit Performance Analysis üìä

Hey there! I'm **Bhavesh**, an Economics major at **DU**, and this is one of my data analysis projects that I'm genuinely excited to share with you.

## ‚ú® Check out the **[live interactive dashboard](https://nbviewer.org/github/bhavbooks/Sales-and-Profit-Analysis-using-Python/blob/main/graphics.html)** to explore the visualizations!

## What This Project Is About

This project takes a close look at **sales and profit performance** using exploratory data analysis techniques. It's a bit like detective work with numbers ‚Äì I'm hunting down patterns in product demand and trying to understand how revenue and profitability vary across different markets.

**Grouping, aggregation, and visualization** work together to turn raw data into stories that make business sense. This analysis highlights both **high-demand products** and **regional sales trends**, offering insights that can help guide strategic decisions.

## üîë What I Discovered

### Top Products by Demand

- **Staples lead with 876 units sold**, which is more than twice as many as the next closest competitor
- Cardinal Index Tabs came in second at **337 units**, followed by File Carts
- The main point is that everyday office essentials often turn out to be the most profitable products

### Sales & Profit Distribution Across Markets

- Not all markets perform the same when it comes to sales and profits.
- Some regions are revenue powerhouses but profit disasters, while others quietly generate sustainable returns
- My stacked bar chart visualizations make it crystal clear **which markets punch above their weight in profitability** versus just raw sales volume

## üõ†Ô∏è How I Built This

**Tech Stack:**

- **Python** (because it's perfect for this kind of work)
- **Pandas** for all the heavy data lifting _(am i good at writing?)_
- **Matplotlib** to make the numbers actually look good

**Approach:**

- Strategic data grouping and aggregation
- Clean, insightful visualizations (bar charts and pie charts that actually tell a story)
- Focus on actionable insights over flashy graphics

## üìà Why This Actually Matters

As an econ student, I'm fascinated by how **volume doesn't always equal value**. This project really shows why it's so important to look at both sides & figure out not just **which products are selling the most**, but also which markets are actually bringing in steady profits. You need both to build a business strategy that actually works.

It's not just about crunching numbers; it's about finding those "aha!" moments that can guide real decisions around pricing, inventory, and market focus. That's the kind of **data-driven insight** that can make or break a business strategy.

_This project reflects my passion for using **economic frameworks** to analyze real datasets and tackle real world problems. I'm driven by the idea of turning raw data into practical solutions that make an actual difference. Feel free to explore the code and **reach out** if you want to discuss the methodology or findings!_
